# TriviaGame
This is a Trivia game.  8 questions will be asked of the player, and the player has 30 seconds to answer them.
After the time is up, the correct and incorrect answers will be tallied, as well as the number of unanswered questions.
The questions are true or false.
Enjoy!

Any images used are found on google image search, not created by me and therefore I do not own them.
One of the questions might be more of an opinion than a fact, and if you disagree with it then feel free to subtract 1 from the number of total questions to increase your total score.  I won't judge you for it, to each their own...
